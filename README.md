In this exercise, I used data from https://pollofpolls.eu/ to study the support for different political parties in Spain. I filtered the data to only show results from reputable polling agencies, and I filtered again to observe the top 5 parties. If I were to take another look at this project, I might look at how animation would let me represent other aspects of the data.
